export const DESCRIPTION = "Travelling, exploring new cultures and sharing stories helped us discover a communicational richness in murals between the creator of the artwork and the receivers. A unique message being an endless source for interpretations. At the same time, We get fascinated by the techniques that allow paper artwork to be transferred on a large surface taking into account the dimensions, distances, perspectives and lines as well as its procedures, materials and tools such as: scaffolds, cranes, stairs, etc.. \n\n We admire the artists who work with these techniques and this is why we started collecting information to show a brief introduction about their work.\n";
